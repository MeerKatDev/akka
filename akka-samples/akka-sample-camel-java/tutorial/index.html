<h2>Asynchronous routing and transformation</h2>

<p>
This example demonstrates how to implement consumer and producer actors that
support 
<a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.3/java/camel.html#Asynchronous_routing" target="_blank">
Asynchronous routing</a> with their Camel endpoints. The sample
application transforms the content of the Akka homepage, <a href="http://akka.io" target="_blank">http://akka.io</a>,
by replacing every occurrence of *Akka* with *AKKA*.
</p>

<p>
To run this example, go to the <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a>
tab, and start the application main class <code>sample.camel.http.HttpExample</code> if it's not already started.
Then  direct the browser to <a href="http://localhost:8875" target="_blank">http://localhost:8875</a> and the
transformed Akka homepage should be displayed. Please note that this example will probably not work if you're
behind an HTTP proxy.
</p>

<p>
The following figure gives an overview how the example actors interact with
external systems and with each other. A browser sends a GET request to
http://localhost:8875 which is the published endpoint of the <code>HttpConsumer</code>
actor. The <code>HttpConsumer</code>actor forwards the requests to the <code>HttpProducer</code>
actor which retrieves the Akka homepage from http://akka.io. The retrieved HTML
is then forwarded to the <code>HttpTransformer</code> actor which replaces all occurrences
of *Akka* with *AKKA*. The transformation result is sent back the HttpConsumer
which finally returns it to the browser.

<p>
Implementing the example actor classes and wiring them together is rather easy
as shown in <a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/camel/http/HttpConsumer.java" class="shortcut">HttpConsumer.java</a>,
<a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/camel/http/HttpProducer.java" class="shortcut">HttpProducer.java</a> and
<a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/camel/http/HttpTransformer.java" class="shortcut">HttpTransformer.java</a>.
</p>


<p>
The <a href="http://camel.apache.org/jetty.html" target="_blank">jetty endpoints</a> of HttpConsumer and 
HttpProducer support asynchronous in-out message exchanges and do not allocate threads for the full duration of
the exchange. This is achieved by using <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Feature/Continuations" target="_blank">Jetty continuations</a>
on the consumer-side and by using <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Tutorial/HttpClient" target="_blank">Jetty's asynchronous HTTP client</a>
on the producer side. The following high-level sequence diagram illustrates that.

<h2>Custom Camel route example</h2>

<p>
This section also demonstrates the combined usage of a <code>Producer</code> and a
<code>Consumer</code> actor as well as the inclusion of a custom Camel route. The
following figure gives an overview.
</p>

<a href="tutorial/camel-custom-route.png" target="_blank"><img src="tutorial/camel-custom-route.png" width="400" /></a>

<ul>
<li>A consumer actor receives a message from an HTTP client</li>

<li>It forwards the message to another actor that transforms the message (encloses
  the original message into hyphens)</li>

<li>The transformer actor forwards the transformed message to a producer actor</li>

<li>The producer actor sends the message to a custom Camel route beginning at the
  <code>direct:welcome</code> endpoint</li>

<li>A processor (transformer) in the custom Camel route prepends "Welcome" to the
  original message and creates a result message</li>

<li>The producer actor sends the result back to the consumer actor which returns
  it to the HTTP client</li>
</ul>

<p>
The consumer, transformer and producer actor implementations are in 
<a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/camel/route/" class="shortcut">sample.camle.route</a>.
</p>

<p>
The producer actor knows where to reply the message to because the consumer and
transformer actors have forwarded the original sender reference as well. The
application configuration and the route starting from direct:welcome are done in the code above.
</p>

<p>
To run this example, go to the <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a>
tab, and start the application main class <code>sample.camel.route.CustomRouteExample</code>
</p>

<p>
POST a message to <code>http://localhost:8877/camel/welcome</code>.
</p>

<pre><code>
   curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "Anke" http://localhost:8877/camel/welcome
</code></pre>

<p>
The response should be:
</p>

<pre><code>
   Welcome - Anke -
</code></pre>

<h2>Quartz Scheduler Example</h2>

<p>
Here is an example showing how simple is to implement a cron-style scheduler by
using the Camel Quartz component in Akka.
</p>
<p>
Open <a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/camel/quartz/MyQuartzActor.java" class="shortcut">MyQuartzActor.java</a>.
</p>
<p>
The example creates a "timer" actor which fires a message every 2
seconds.
</p>
